We will try to analyse what should be our directional view for intra-day trades when market gaps up/down.

Generally, when the market gap's up we expect to see there's a bullish view on stock and similarly for gap down a bearish view. 

Keeping that in mind let's pick PNB stock for this analysis and lets try to see how the share price performed in a day during gap up/gap down days.


@[after-graph]

(üìà Chart is Interactive)

This graph tells movement of shares price in a given day when there's a gap up/down of more than 4%.

We can observe that most of the days are concentrated in two areas covered in rectangles.

Surprisingly, we can see there's inverse relation. If there's a gap up we can see day ended in loss that appears in the Green rectangle. Similarly if there's a gap down we can observe day ended high as observed in Red rectangle.

To make more sense consider the day when there was the highest gap-up i.e on 2002-07-15 @18% if we observe the day went down by -12.92% üò≤. If a trader with bullish view takes a long call then he would have definitely hit loss üò≠.

Therefore it is suggested to, preferably take reverse calls whenever there's a **gap up/down i.e, taking short and long calls** respectively.  ‚ùó(Not an advisory)

We can also see out of all the gap opening days, how many short/long opportunities can be grabbed.

## Extra Gyaan

Share price üíµ of a company in stock market moves up ‚¨ÜÔ∏è and down ‚¨áÔ∏è depending on supply and demand of shares. Traders and Investors can participate only during market active hours. In India popular Stock Markets NSE, BSE trade actively during 9:15am to 3:20pm.

### Intra-Day
Intraday is a style of trading preferred by traders who buy and sell shares on the same day. There is also a provision given by stock market where traders can sell and later buy them, this is called short selling.

The price at which shares start trading when market opens is called opening price. Similarly, when market closes then the price of shares are called closing price.

### Gap Up/Down
As the Market opens the next day with a new ray ‚òÄÔ∏è of hope. The Share price will not be the same as the previous day's closing price. It shots up/down depending on various factors such as there's a news that got public during market off hours, results declaration of the company etc..,. So there are various factors on which a company's opening price changes. If the opening price is different to previous day's closing price with a large factor then we call such scenarios as gap up open (open price is more than closing price) and gap down open (open price is less than closing price).
